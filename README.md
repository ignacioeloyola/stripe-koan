# Stripe Koan

## Welcome to this small koan for the Stipe: Can I pay with madnesss? presentation

First of all, this is an Android project. I could not prepare an iOS project, but I hope you can get a grasp on the main concepts.

You will find a Store, the great Emoji Store, where you can buy all your favorite emoji clothes and accessories.

### There is one problem with our store. The payment system does not work :(

The project can be compiled, but it looks like there are some parameters that are not properly configured.

Your task in this koan is to find out what parameters must be configured, and in which place they must be put.

You will need the publishable key: pk_test_51LpWx4LIl8UswShOFHal4NHQR22inYDzq3VPhEMXEa3ic0a1S99Ivo0WRhhRFxhAthMr7kNYKfwBQgi9EmilqACc00nl4eFtr8

I hope you can enjoy this journey ^^
